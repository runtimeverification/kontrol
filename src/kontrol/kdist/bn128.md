BN128 curve operations. These functions are part of the operations introduced in EIP-197, aimed at representing operations performed by precompiled contracts that operate on the elliptic curve alt_bn128.

```k

module BN128-OPERATIONS
    imports EVM

    syntax Bool ::= isValidPointSymbolic(G1Point) [function, total, no-evaluators, smtlib(isValidG1Point)]
    rule isValidPoint(G) => isValidPointSymbolic(G) [priority(30)]

    syntax G1Point ::= BN128MulOp(G1Point, Int) [function, total, smtlib(BN128Mul)]
    rule BN128Mul(G, I) => BN128MulOp(G:G1Point, I:Int) [priority(30)]
    rule BN128MulOp((PA:Int, PB:Int):G1Point, I:Int) => (PA *Int I , PB *Int I):G1Point


    syntax G1Point ::= BN128AddOp(G1Point, G1Point) [function, total, smtlib(BN128Add)]
    rule BN128Add(PA, PB) => BN128AddOp(PA, PB) [priority(30)]
    rule BN128AddOp((PAA:Int, PAB:Int):G1Point, (PBA:Int, PBB:Int):G1Point) => (PAA +Int PBA , PAB +Int PBB):G1Point
